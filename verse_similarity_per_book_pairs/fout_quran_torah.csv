 0.8851,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.","And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: ""Tell me the names of these if ye are right."""
 0.9071,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.","But his Lord chose him (for His Grace): He turned to him, and gave him Guidance."
 0.9076,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.","""Then he brought out (of the fire) before the (people) the image of a calf: It seemed to low: so they said: This is your god, and the god of Moses, but (Moses) has forgotten!"""
 0.9122,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.","We did aforetime give Moses the (Book of) Guidance, and We gave the book in inheritance to the Children of Israel,-"
 0.9483,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:","But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he (came up and) said: ""I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba with tidings true."
 0.9340,"And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.","""O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Thy Sacred House; in order, O our Lord, that they may establish regular Prayer: so fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: so that they may give thanks."
 0.9226,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.","So the king said: ""Bring ye him unto me."" But when the messenger came to him, (Joseph) said: ""Go thou back to thy lord, and ask him, 'What is the state of mind of the ladies who cut their hands'? For my Lord is certainly well aware of their snare."""
 0.9132,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;","And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed: But we gave her glad tidings of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob."
 0.9356,"And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.","""That We might try them by that (means). But if any turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will cause him to undergo a severe Penalty."
 0.9331,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:","And Noah called upon his Lord, and said: ""O my Lord! surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true, and Thou art the justest of Judges!"""
 0.9447,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.","He said, ""O my Lord! Forgive me, and grant me a kingdom which, (it may be), suits not another after me: for Thou art the Grantor of Bounties (without measure)."
 0.9136,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.","""'Throw (the child) into the chest, and throw (the chest) into the river: the river will cast him up on the bank, and he will be taken up by one who is an enemy to Me and an enemy to him': But I cast (the garment of) love over thee from Me: and (this) in order that thou mayest be reared under Mine eye."
 0.9493,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.","A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life, and produce grain therefrom, of which ye do eat."
 0.9231,And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;,"We did, before them, try the people of Pharaoh: there came to them a messenger most honourable,"
 0.8615,"Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,","(Take) eight (head of cattle) in (four) pairs: of sheep a pair, and of goats a pair; say, hath He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose?

 0.8816,"Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.","When the she-camels, ten months with young, are left untended;"
 0.9196,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.","And to Solomon (We made) the Wind (obedient): Its early morning (stride) was a month's (journey), and its evening (stride) was a month's (journey); and We made a Font of molten brass to flow for him; and there were Jinns that worked in front of him, by the leave of his Lord, and if any of them turned aside from our command, We made him taste of the Penalty of the Blazing Fire."
 0.9318,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?","Thus have we sent thee amongst a People before whom (long since) have (other) Peoples (gone and) passed away; in order that thou mightest rehearse unto them what We send down unto thee by inspiration; yet do they reject (Him), the Most Gracious!

 0.9458,"Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.","He said: ""So (it will be): Thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us': It is a matter (so) decreed."""
 0.9332,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.","Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding), they held a conference in private. The leader among them said: ""Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah's name, and how, before this, ye did fail in your duty with Joseph? Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me, or Allah commands me; and He is the best to command."
 0.9404,"And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.","He said, ""O my Lord! Forgive me, and grant me a kingdom which, (it may be), suits not another after me: for Thou art the Grantor of Bounties (without measure)."
 0.9153,So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.,(He left them) as they were: We completely understood what was before him.
 0.9063,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.","And Thamud, and the people of Lut, and the Companions of the Wood; - such were the Confederates."
 0.8916,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.","And on them did Satan prove true his idea, and they followed him, all but a party that believed."
 0.9107,And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.,"And in the hour of early dawn, they (were found) praying for Forgiveness;"
 0.8584,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.","He said, ""Nay, throw ye first!"" Then behold their ropes and their rods-so it seemed to him on account of their magic - began to be in lively motion!"
 0.9136,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.","(Iblis) said: ""O my Lord! because Thou hast put me in the wrong, I will make (wrong) fair-seeming to them on the earth, and I will put them all in the wrong,-"
 0.8573,"And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.","So the king said: ""Bring ye him unto me."" But when the messenger came to him, (Joseph) said: ""Go thou back to thy lord, and ask him, 'What is the state of mind of the ladies who cut their hands'? For my Lord is certainly well aware of their snare."""
 0.9366,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.","And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our place of meeting: when they were seized with violent quaking, he prayed: ""O my Lord! if it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed, long before, both them and me: wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? this is no more than Thy trial: by it Thou causest whom Thou wilt to stray, and Thou leadest whom Thou wilt into the right path. Thou art our Protector: so forgive us and give us Thy mercy; for Thou art the best of those who forgive."
 0.9016,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.","If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with their Lord! He will say: ""Is not this the truth?"" They will say: ""Yea, by our Lord!"" He will say: ""Taste ye then the penalty, because ye rejected Faith."""
 0.9343,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.","And We gave (Abraham) Isaac and Jacob, and ordained among his progeny Prophethood and Revelation, and We granted him his reward in this life; and he was in the Hereafter (of the company) of the Righteous."
 0.9131,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.","Until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no covering protection against the sun."
 0.9309,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.","For those who followed the Jewish Law, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them that fat of the ox and the sheep, except what adheres to their backs or their entrails, or is mixed up with a bone: this in recompense for their wilful disobedience: for We are true (in Our ordinances)."
 0.8888,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.","And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed: But we gave her glad tidings of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob."
 0.9159,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.","And We gave (Abraham) Isaac and Jacob, and ordained among his progeny Prophethood and Revelation, and We granted him his reward in this life; and he was in the Hereafter (of the company) of the Righteous."

 0.9091,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.","He said: ""So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!'"""
 0.9433,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.","So he smiled, amused at her speech; and he said: ""O my Lord! so order me that I may be grateful for Thy favours, which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: And admit me, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants."""
