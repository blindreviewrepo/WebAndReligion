 0.8282,A. L. M.,Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
 0.9262,"This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fear Allah;","Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;"
 0.8955,"Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;","Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;"
 0.9407,"And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee, and sent before thy time, and (in their hearts) have the assurance of the Hereafter.","And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
 0.9384,"They are on (true) guidance, from their Lord, and it is these who will prosper.","And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
 0.9115,"As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.","And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith."
 0.9306,"Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur).","The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel."
 0.8880,"Of the people there are some who say: ""We believe in Allah and the Last Day;"" but they do not (really) believe.","And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him."
 0.9031,"Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves, and realise (it) not!","Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes."
 0.9416,"In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease: And grievous is the penalty they (incur), because they are false (to themselves).","The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes."
 0.9119,"When it is said to them: ""Make not mischief on the earth,"" they say: ""Why, we only Want to make peace!""","There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people."

Nay, of a surety they are the fools, but they do not know.","There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people."
 0.8493,"When they meet those who believe, they say: ""We believe;"" but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say: ""We are really with you: We (were) only jesting.""","And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith."
 0.9435,"Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones (To and fro).","Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."
 0.9206,"These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic is profitless, and they have lost true direction,","They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation."
 0.9072,"Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness. So they could not see.","And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly."
 0.9122,"Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return (to the path).","The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs."
 0.9307,"Or (another similitude) is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky: In it are zones of darkness, and thunder and lightning: They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap, the while they are in terror of death. But Allah is ever round the rejecters of Faith!","The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs."
 0.9177,"The lightning all but snatches away their sight; every time the light (Helps) them, they walk therein, and when the darkness grows on them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing; for Allah hath power over all things.","But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD."
 0.9327,"O ye people! Adore your Guardian-Lord, who created you and those who came before you, that ye may have the chance to learn righteousness;","And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war."
 0.9411,"Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know (the truth).","And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel."
 0.9259,"And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Our servant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses or helpers (If there are any) besides Allah, if your (doubts) are true.","If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering."
 0.9387,"But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith.",Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
 0.9487,"But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that their portion is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: ""Why, this is what we were fed with before,"" for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein (for ever).","And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."
 0.9398,"Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things, lowest as well as highest. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those who reject Faith say: ""What means Allah by this similitude?"" By it He causes many to stray, and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not to stray, except those who forsake (the path),-","This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation."
 0.9396,"Those who break Allah's Covenant after it is ratified, and who sunder what Allah Has ordered to be joined, and do mischief on earth: These cause loss (only) to themselves.","This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation."
 0.9229,"How can ye reject the faith in Allah?- seeing that ye were without life, and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and will again bring you to life; and again to Him will ye return.","And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever."
 0.9338,"It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth; Moreover His design comprehended the heavens, for He gave order and perfection to the seven firmaments; and of all things He hath perfect knowledge.","He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen."
 0.9462,"Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: ""I will create a vicegerent on earth."" They said: ""Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?"" He said: ""I know what ye know not.""","And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake."
 0.9155,"And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: ""Tell me the names of these if ye are right.""","And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus."
 0.9199,"They said: ""Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hast taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom.""","That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD."
 0.8998,"He said: ""O Adam! Tell them their names."" When he had told them, Allah said: ""Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal?""","And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them."
 0.9220,"And behold, We said to the angels: ""Bow down to Adam"" and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith.","And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth."
 0.9401,"We said: ""O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.""","And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:"
 0.9164,"Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: ""Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time.""","Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it."
 0.9327,"Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord Turned towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.","And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses."
 0.9360,"We said: ""Get ye down all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from me, whosoever follows My guidance, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do."
 0.9326,"""But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they shall be companions of the Fire; they shall abide therein.""","Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not."
 0.9222,"O Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil your covenant with Me as I fulfil My Covenant with you, and fear none but Me.","Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you."
 0.9267,"And believe in what I reveal, confirming the revelation which is with you, and be not the first to reject Faith therein, nor sell My Signs for a small price; and fear Me, and Me alone.","Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it."
 0.9187,"And cover not Truth with falsehood, nor conceal the Truth when ye know (what it is).",Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
 0.9194,And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in worship).,"Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."
 0.9386,"Do ye enjoin right conduct on the people, and forget (To practise it) yourselves, and yet ye study the Scripture? Will ye not understand?","And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."
 0.9335,"Nay, seek (Allah's) help with patient perseverance and prayer: It is indeed hard, except to those who bring a lowly spirit,-","Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."
 0.9054,"Who bear in mind the certainty that they are to meet their Lord, and that they are to return to Him.","But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see."
 0.9282,"Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all other (for My Message).","And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
 0.9448,"Then guard yourselves against a day when one soul shall not avail another nor shall intercession be accepted for her, nor shall compensation be taken from her, nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).","Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you."
 0.9269,"And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.","Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection."
 0.9285,And remember We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh's people within your very sight.,"And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign."
 0.9478,"And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence ye took the calf (for worship), and ye did grievous wrong.","And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven."
 0.8865,Even then We did forgive you; there was a chance for you to be grateful.,"And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you."
 0.9336,And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion (Between right and wrong): There was a chance for you to be guided aright.,"Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob."
 0.9054,"And remember Moses said to his people: ""O my people! Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance) to your Maker, and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker."" Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness): For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.","Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people."
 0.9256,"And remember ye said: ""O Moses! We shall never believe in thee until we see Allah manifestly,"" but ye were dazed with thunder and lighting even as ye looked on.","With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
 0.9011,Then We raised you up after your death: Ye had the chance to be grateful.,"For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?"
 0.9293,"And We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down to you Manna and quails, saying: ""Eat of the good things We have provided for you:"" (But they rebelled); to us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.","Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection."
 0.9364,"And remember We said: ""Enter this town, and eat of the plenty therein as ye wish; but enter the gate with humility, in posture and in words, and We shall forgive you your faults and increase (the portion of) those who do good.""","And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:"
 0.9265,"But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given them; so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven, for that they infringed (Our command) repeatedly.","(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)"
 0.9376,"And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: ""Strike the rock with thy staff."" Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by Allah, and do no evil nor mischief on the (face of the) earth.","Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
 0.9425,"And remember ye said: ""O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils, and onions."" He said: ""Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!"" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled and went on transgressing.","And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
 0.9353,"Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.","Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;"
 0.9288,"And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (The towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): ""Hold firmly to what We have given you and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein: Perchance ye may fear Allah.""",And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
 0.9030,"But ye turned back thereafter: Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allah to you, ye had surely been among the lost.","And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you."
 0.9084,"And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath: We said to them: ""Be ye apes, despised and rejected.""","Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence."
 0.9021,"So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity, and a lesson to those who fear Allah.","So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations."
 0.9214,"And remember Moses said to his people: ""Allah commands that ye sacrifice a heifer."" They said: ""Makest thou a laughing-stock of us?"" He said: ""Allah save me from being an ignorant (fool)!""","And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?"
 0.9218,"They said: ""Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what (heifer) it is!"" He said; ""He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too young, but of middling age. Now do what ye are commanded!""","And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance."
 0.9187,"They said: ""Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us Her colour."" He said: ""He says: A fawn-coloured heifer, pure and rich in tone, the admiration of beholders!""","And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved."
 0.9317,"They said: ""Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what she is: To us are all heifers alike: We wish indeed for guidance, if Allah wills.""","And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance."
 0.9368,"He said: ""He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields; sound and without blemish."" They said: ""Now hast thou brought the truth."" Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good-will.","And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city."
 0.9393,Remember ye slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to the crime: But Allah was to bring forth what ye did hide.,"And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him."
 0.9270,"So We said: ""Strike the (body) with a piece of the (heifer)."" Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs: Perchance ye may understand.","And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses."
 0.9100,Thenceforth were your hearts hardened: They became like a rock and even worse in hardness. For among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth; others there are which when split asunder send forth water; and others which sink for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.,"Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it."
 0.9368,"Can ye (o ye men of Faith) entertain the hope that they will believe in you?- Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of Allah, and perverted it knowingly after they understood it.","And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."
 0.9322,"Behold! when they meet the men of Faith, they say: ""We believe"": But when they meet each other in private, they say: ""Shall you tell them what Allah hath revealed to you, that they may engage you in argument about it before your Lord?""- Do ye not understand (their aim)?","And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found."

 0.9211,"And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but (see therein their own) desires, and they do nothing but conjecture.","And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."
 0.8940,"Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say:""This is from Allah,"" to traffic with it for miserable price!- Woe to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby.","That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God."
 0.9310,"And they say: ""The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days:"" Say: ""Have ye taken a promise from Allah, for He never breaks His promise? or is it that ye say of Allah what ye do not know?""","And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found."
 0.9505,"Nay, those who seek gain in evil, and are girt round by their sins,- they are companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide (For ever).","The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes."
 0.9333,"But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of the Garden: Therein shall they abide (For ever).","Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety."
 0.9480,"And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (to this effect): Worship none but Allah; treat with kindness your parents and kindred, and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer; and practise regular charity. Then did ye turn back, except a few among you, and ye backslide (even now).","And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel."
 0.9358,"And remember We took your covenant (to this effect): Shed no blood amongst you, nor turn out your own people from your homes: and this ye solemnly ratified, and to this ye can bear witness.","And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:"
 0.9473,"After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against them, in guilt and rancour; and if they come to you as captives, ye ransom them, though it was not lawful for you to banish them. Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in, and do ye reject the rest? but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty.

This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.

 0.9344,"From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a covenant, but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so we estranged them, with enmity and hatred between the one and the other, to the day of judgment.

They change the words from their (right) times and places: they say, ""If ye are given this, take it, but if not, beware!"" If any one's trial is intended by Allah, thou hast no authority in the least for him against Allah. For such - it is not Allah's will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment.","And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel."

 0.9325,"It was We who revealed the law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the prophets who bowed (as in Islam) to Allah's will, by the rabbis and the doctors of law: for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's book, and they were witnesses thereto: therefore fear not men, but fear me, and sell not my signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) Unbelievers.","And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:"

If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute;","This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation."

Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched: He giveth and spendeth (of His bounty) as He pleaseth.

We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: ""Strike the rock with thy staff"": out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, (saying): ""Eat of the good things We have provided for you"": (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.","He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,"

For that they repeatedly transgressed.,"For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments."
 0.9324,"Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them, openly holding up their heads, but on the day they had no Sabbath, they came not: thus did We make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression.","And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians."

(Even so), if similar vanities came their way, they would (again) seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth? and they study what is in the Book.

We do testify!"" (This), lest ye should say on the Day of Judgment: ""Of this we were never mindful"":","And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?

 0.9245,"The (Brethren) sold him for a miserable price, for a few dirhams counted out: in such low estimation did they hold him!","And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:"
 0.9444,"The man in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: ""Make his stay (among us) honourable: may be he will bring us much good, or we shall adopt him as a son."" Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of stories (and events). And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not.","When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;"
 0.9169,"When Joseph attained His full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: thus do We reward those who do right.","It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed."
 0.9406,"But she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him from his (true) self: she fastened the doors, and said: ""Now come, thou (dear one)!"" He said: ""Allah forbid! truly (thy husband) is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly to no good come those who do wrong!""","Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof."
 0.9444,"And (with passion) did she desire him, and he would have desired her, but that he saw the evidence of his Lord: thus (did We order) that We might turn away from him (all) evil and shameful deeds: for he was one of Our servants, sincere and purified.","The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes."
 0.9196,"So they both raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back: they both found her lord near the door. She said: ""What is the (fitting) punishment for one who formed an evil design against thy wife, but prison or a grievous chastisement?""","And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?"
 0.9264,"He said: ""It was she that sought to seduce me - from my (true) self."" And one of her household saw (this) and bore witness, (thus):- ""If it be that his shirt is rent from the front, then is her tale true, and he is a liar!","And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:"
 0.8830,"""But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then is she the liar, and he is telling the truth!""","And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?"
 0.9110,"So when he saw his shirt,- that it was torn at the back,- (her husband) said: ""Behold! It is a snare of you women! truly, mighty is your snare!","So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision."
 0.9247,"""O Joseph, pass this over! (O wife), ask forgiveness for thy sin, for truly thou hast been at fault!""","Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them."
 0.9378,"Ladies said in the City: ""The wife of the (great) 'Aziz is seeking to seduce her slave from his (true) self: Truly hath he inspired her with violent love: we see she is evidently going astray.""","Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:"
 0.9135,"When she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them: she gave each of them a knife: and she said (to Joseph), ""Come out before them."" When they saw him, they did extol him, and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said, ""Allah preserve us! no mortal is this! this is none other than a noble angel!""","And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:"
 0.9328,"She said: ""There before you is the man about whom ye did blame me! I did seek to seduce him from his (true) self but he did firmly save himself guiltless!.... and now, if he doth not my bidding, he shall certainly be cast into prison, and (what is more) be of the company of the vilest!""","Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;"

 0.9496,"So his Lord hearkened to him (in his prayer), and turned away from him their snare: Verily He heareth and knoweth (all things).","And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses."
 0.9154,"Then it occurred to the men, after they had seen the signs, (that it was best) to imprison him for a time.",And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
 0.8877,"Now with him there came into the prison two young men. Said one of them: ""I see myself (in a dream) pressing wine."" said the other: ""I see myself (in a dream) carrying bread on my head, and birds are eating, thereof."" ""Tell us"" (they said) ""The truth and meaning thereof: for we see thou art one that doth good (to all).""","But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife."
 0.9054,"He said: ""Before any food comes (in due course) to feed either of you, I will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you: that is part of the (duty) which my Lord hath taught me. I have (I assure you) abandoned the ways of a people that believe not in Allah and that (even) deny the Hereafter.","And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,"
 0.9354,"""And I follow the ways of my fathers,- Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and never could we attribute any partners whatever to Allah: that (comes) of the grace of Allah to us and to mankind: yet most men are not grateful.","Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:"
 0.9226,"""O my two companions of the prison! (I ask you): are many lords differing among themselves better, or the One Allah, Supreme and Irresistible?","Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God."
 0.9331,"""If not Him, ye worship nothing but names which ye have named,- ye and your fathers,- for which Allah hath sent down no authority: the command is for none but Allah: He hath commanded that ye worship none but Him: that is the right religion, but most men understand not...","(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them."
 0.9407,"""O my two companions of the prison! As to one of you, he will pour out the wine for his lord to drink: as for the other, he will hang from the cross, and the birds will eat from off his head.

 0.9314,"And of the two, to that one whom he consider about to be saved, he said: ""Mention me to thy lord."" But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord: and (Joseph) lingered in prison a few (more) years.","When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;"
 0.9474,"The king (of Egypt) said: ""I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs!

 0.8917,"They said: ""A confused medley of dreams: and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams.""","And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
 0.9276,"But the man who had been released, one of the two (who had been in prison) and who now bethought him after (so long) a space of time, said: ""I will tell you the truth of its interpretation: send ye me (therefore).""","And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled."
 0.9451,"""O Joseph!"" (he said) ""O man of truth!

 0.9498,"(Joseph) said: ""For seven years shall ye diligently sow as is your wont: and the harvests that ye reap, ye shall leave them in the ear,- except a little, of which ye shall eat.","And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."
 0.9368,"""Then will come after that (period) seven dreadful (years), which will devour what ye shall have laid by in advance for them,- (all) except a little which ye shall have (specially) guarded.","If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for."

 0.9278,"So the king said: ""Bring ye him unto me."" But when the messenger came to him, (Joseph) said: ""Go thou back to thy lord, and ask him, 'What is the state of mind of the ladies who cut their hands'? For my Lord is certainly well aware of their snare.""","And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye?

 0.9331,"(The king) said (to the ladies): ""What was your affair when ye did seek to seduce Joseph from his (true) self?"" The ladies said: ""Allah preserve us! no evil know we against him!""

 0.9260,"""This (say I), in order that He may know that I have never been false to him in his absence, and that Allah will never guide the snare of the false ones.","Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;"
 0.9362,"""Nor do I absolve my own self (of blame): the (human) soul is certainly prone to evil, unless my Lord do bestow His Mercy: but surely my Lord is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.""","(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them."
 0.9405,"So the king said: ""Bring him unto me; I will take him specially to serve about my own person."" Therefore when he had spoken to him, he said: ""Be assured this day, thou art, before our own presence, with rank firmly established, and fidelity fully proved!","And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:"
 0.9337,"(Joseph) said: ""Set me over the store-houses of the land: I will indeed guard them, as one that knows (their importance).""","And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence."
 0.9312,"Thus did We give established power to Joseph in the land, to take possession therein as, when, or where he pleased. We bestow of our Mercy on whom We please, and We suffer not, to be lost, the reward of those who do good.","Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD."
 0.9280,"But verily the reward of the Hereafter is the best, for those who believe, and are constant in righteousness.","The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation."
 0.9301,"Then came Joseph's brethren: they entered his presence, and he knew them, but they knew him not.","And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
 0.9391,"And when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he said: ""Bring unto me a brother ye have, of the same father as yourselves, (but a different mother): see ye not that I pay out full measure, and that I do provide the best hospitality?","And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:"
 0.9372,"""Now if ye bring him not to me, ye shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall ye (even) come near me.""","But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
 0.9078,"They said: ""We shall certainly seek to get our wish about him from his father: Indeed we shall do it.""","And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth."
 0.9332,"And (Joseph) told his servants to put their stock-in-trade (with which they had bartered) into their saddle-bags, so they should know it only when they returned to their people, in order that they might come back.","Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them."
 0.9210,"Now when they returned to their father, they said: ""O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother): So send our brother with us, that we may get our measure; and we will indeed take every care of him.""","When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:"
 0.9202,"He said: ""Shall I trust you with him with any result other than when I trusted you with his brother aforetime?

 0.8892,"Then when they opened their baggage, they found their stock-in-trade had been returned to them. They said: ""O our father! What (more) can we desire? this our stock-in-trade has been returned to us: so we shall get (more) food for our family; We shall take care of our brother; and add (at the same time) a full camel's load (of grain to our provisions). This is but a small quantity.","And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
 0.9288,"(Jacob) said: ""Never will I send him with you until ye swear a solemn oath to me, in Allah's name, that ye will be sure to bring him back to me unless ye are yourselves hemmed in (and made powerless).

Not that I can profit you aught against Allah (with my advice): None can command except Allah: On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trust put their trust on Him.""","But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people."
 0.9312,"And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined, it did not profit them in the least against (the plan of) Allah: It was but a necessity of Jacob's soul, which he discharged. For he was, by our instruction, full of knowledge (and experience): but most men know not.","And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him."
 0.9294,"Now when they came into Joseph's presence, he received his (full) brother to stay with him. He said (to him): ""Behold! I am thy (own) brother; so grieve not at aught of their doings.""","And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him."
 0.9323,"At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he put the drinking cup into his brother's saddle-bag. Then shouted out a crier: ""O ye (in) the caravan! behold! ye are thieves, without doubt!""","And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth."
 0.8879,"They said, turning towards them: ""What is it that ye miss?""","And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?"
 0.9410,"They said: ""We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load; I will be bound by it.""","That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you."
 0.9209,"(The brothers) said: ""By Allah! well ye know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are no thieves!""","And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:"
 0.9266,"(The Egyptians) said: ""What then shall be the penalty of this, if ye are (proved) to have lied?""","And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."
 0.9396,"They said: ""The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found, should be held (as bondman) to atone for the (crime).

 0.9368,"So he began (the search) with their baggage, before (he came to) the baggage of his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother's baggage. Thus did We plan for Joseph.

We raise to degrees (of wisdom) whom We please: but over all endued with knowledge is one, the All-Knowing.","And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:"
 0.9353,"They said: ""If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before (him)."" But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing not the secrets to them.

 0.9422,"Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding), they held a conference in private. The leader among them said: ""Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah's name, and how, before this, ye did fail in your duty with Joseph?

 0.8822,"And he turned away from them, and said: ""How great is my grief for Joseph!"" And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silent melancholy.","And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me."

 0.8799,"And yet they had already covenanted with Allah not to turn their backs, and a covenant with Allah must (surely) be answered for.","And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses."
 0.9086,"Say: ""Running away will not profit you if ye are running away from death or slaughter; and even if (ye do escape), no more than a brief (respite) will ye be allowed to enjoy!""","Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:"
 0.9058,"Say: ""Who is it that can screen you from Allah if it be His wish to give you punishment or to give you Mercy?"" Nor will they find for themselves, besides Allah, any protector or helper.","(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them."
 0.9134,"Verily Allah knows those among you who keep back (men) and those who say to their brethren, ""Come along to us"", but come not to the fight except for just a little while.","But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves."
 0.9439,"Covetous over you. Then when fear comes, thou wilt see them looking to thee, their eyes revolving, like (those of) one over whom hovers death: but when the fear is past, they will smite you with sharp tongues, covetous of goods. Such men have no faith, and so Allah has made their deeds of none effect: and that is easy for Allah.","And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."
 0.9046,"They think that the Confederates have not withdrawn; and if the Confederates should come (again), they would wish they were in the deserts (wandering) among the Bedouins, and seeking news about you (from a safe distance); and if they were in your midst, they would fight but little.","Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this."
 0.9331,"Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah a beautiful pattern (of conduct) for any one whose hope is in Allah and the Final Day, and who engages much in the Praise of Allah.","Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;"
 0.8893,"When the Believers saw the Confederate forces, they said: ""This is what Allah and his Messenger had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger told us what was true."" And it only added to their faith and their zeal in obedience.","And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth."
 0.9202,"Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah: of them some have completed their vow (to the extreme), and some (still) wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least:","Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:"
 0.9307,"That Allah may reward the men of Truth for their Truth, and punish the Hypocrites if that be His Will, or turn to them in Mercy: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation."
 0.9224,"And Allah turned back the Unbelievers for (all) their fury: no advantage did they gain; and enough is Allah for the believers in their fight. And Allah is full of Strength, able to enforce His Will.","For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you."
 0.9222,"And those of the People of the Book who aided them - Allah did take them down from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts. (So that) some ye slew, and some ye made prisoners.","And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us."
 0.9249,"And He made you heirs of their lands, their houses, and their goods, and of a land which ye had not frequented (before). And Allah has power over all things.","And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers."
 0.9274,"O Prophet! Say to thy Consorts: ""If it be that ye desire the life of this World, and its glitter,- then come! I will provide for your enjoyment and set you free in a handsome manner.","Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle."
 0.9220,"But if ye seek Allah and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, verily Allah has prepared for the well-doers amongst you a great reward.","And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel."
 0.9176,"O Consorts of the Prophet! If any of you were guilty of evident unseemly conduct, the Punishment would be doubled to her, and that is easy for Allah.","And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering."
 0.9089,"But any of you that is devout in the service of Allah and His Messenger, and works righteousness,- to her shall We grant her reward twice: and We have prepared for her a generous Sustenance.","Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded."
 0.9424,"O Consorts of the Prophet! Ye are not like any of the (other) women: if ye do fear (Allah), be not too complacent of speech, lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire: but speak ye a speech (that is) just.","Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted."
 0.9269,"And stay quietly in your houses, and make not a dazzling display, like that of the former Times of Ignorance; and establish regular Prayer, and give regular Charity; and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless.","The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
 0.9160,"And recite what is rehearsed to you in your homes, of the Signs of Allah and His Wisdom: for Allah understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted (with them).","Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded."
 0.8799,"For Muslim men and women,- for believing men and women, for devout men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient and constant, for men and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in Charity, for men and women who fast (and deny themselves), for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in Allah's praise,- for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.","And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses."
 0.9069,"It is not fitting for a Believer, man or woman, when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if any one disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path.","When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;"
 0.9441,"Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favour: ""Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife, and fear Allah."" But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, with the necessary (formality), We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And Allah's command must be fulfilled.","Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance."
 0.9215,There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what Allah has indicated to him as a duty. It was the practice (approved) of Allah amongst those of old that have passed away. And the command of Allah is a decree determined.,"This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation."
 0.9239,"(It is the practice of those) who preach the Messages of Allah, and fear Him, and fear none but Allah. And enough is Allah to call (men) to account.","When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;"
 0.9004,"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah, and the Seal of the Prophets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things.","And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father."
 0.9120,"O ye who believe! Celebrate the praises of Allah, and do this often;","Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God."
 0.8922,And glorify Him morning and evening.,And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
 0.9307,"He it is Who sends blessings on you, as do His angels, that He may bring you out from the depths of Darkness into Light: and He is Full of Mercy to the Believers.","The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
 0.9028,"Their salutation on the Day they meet Him will be ""Peace!""; and He has prepared for them a generous Reward.","And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?"
 0.9215,"O Prophet! Truly We have sent thee as a Witness, a Bearer of Glad Tidings, and Warner,-","And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
 0.9263,"And as one who invites to Allah's (grace) by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light.","And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering."
 0.8871,"Then give the Glad Tidings to the Believers, that they shall have from Allah a very great Bounty.","And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations."
 0.9351,"And obey not (the behests) of the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and heed not their annoyances, but put thy Trust in Allah. For enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.","Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."
 0.9365,"O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women, and then divorce them before ye have touched them, no period of 'Iddat have ye to count in respect of them: so give them a present. And set them free in a handsome manner.","But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof."
 0.9303,"O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts, and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts, who migrated (from Makka) with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her;- this only for thee, and not for the Believers (at large); We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess;- in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you."
 0.9431,"Thou mayest defer (the turn of) any of them that thou pleasest, and thou mayest receive any thou pleasest: and there is no blame on thee if thou invite one whose (turn) thou hadst set aside. This were nigher to the cooling of their eyes, the prevention of their grief, and their satisfaction - that of all of them - with that which thou hast to give them: and Allah knows (all) that is in your hearts: and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.",And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.
 0.9478,"It is not lawful for thee (to marry more) women after this, nor to change them for (other) wives, even though their beauty attract thee, except any thy right hand should possess (as handmaidens): and Allah doth watch over all things.","Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance."
 0.9352,"O ye who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses,- until leave is given you,- for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation: but when ye are invited, enter; and when ye have taken your meal, disperse, without seeking familiar talk. Such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet: he is ashamed to dismiss you, but Allah is not ashamed (to tell you) the truth. And when ye ask (his ladies) for anything ye want, ask them from before a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs. Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy Allah's Messenger, or that ye should marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in Allah's sight an enormity.","When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:"
 0.9127,"Whether ye reveal anything or conceal it, verily Allah has full knowledge of all things.",Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

And, (ladies), fear Allah; for Allah is Witness to all things.","Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:"
 0.9286,"Allah and His angels send blessings on the Prophet: O ye that believe!

 0.9048,"Those who annoy Allah and His Messenger - Allah has cursed them in this World and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating Punishment.","And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel."
 0.9434,"And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, bear (on themselves) a calumny and a glaring sin.","Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation."
 0.9313,"O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): that is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them."
 0.9474,"Truly, if the Hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who stir up sedition in the City, desist not, We shall certainly stir thee up against them: Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbours for any length of time:","The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes."
 0.9431,"They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found, they shall be seized and slain (without mercy).","A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them."
 0.9149,(Such was) the practice (approved) of Allah among those who lived aforetime: No change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of Allah.,"(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them."
 0.9337,"Men ask thee concerning the Hour: Say, ""The knowledge thereof is with Allah (alone)"": and what will make thee understand?- perchance the Hour is nigh!","And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found."
 0.9227,"Verily Allah has cursed the Unbelievers and prepared for them a Blazing Fire,-","Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant."

Would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger!""","Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!"
 0.9164,"And they would say: ""Our Lord! We obeyed our chiefs and our great ones, and they misled us as to the (right) Path.","And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw."

 0.9346,"O ye who believe! Be ye not like those who vexed and insulted Moses, but Allah cleared him of the (calumnies) they had uttered: and he was honourable in Allah's sight.","Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."
 0.9192,"O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and (always) say a word directed to the Right:",Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
 0.9202,"That He may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins: He that obeys Allah and His Messenger, has already attained the highest achievement.","Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;"
 0.8959,"We did indeed offer the Trust to the Heavens and the Earth and the Mountains; but they refused to undertake it, being afraid thereof: but man undertook it;- He was indeed unjust and foolish;-","Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said."

 0.9087,Truly they found their fathers on the wrong Path;,But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
 0.9068,So they (too) were rushed down on their footsteps!,"Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz."
 0.9163,"And truly before them, many of the ancients went astray;-","Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD."
 0.9284,"But We sent aforetime, among them, (messengers) to admonish them;-","And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."
 0.9216,"Then see what was the end of those who were admonished (but heeded not),-","O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!"
 0.8868,Except the sincere (and devoted) Servants of Allah.,"This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them."
 0.9288,"(In the days of old), Noah cried to Us, and We are the best to hear prayer.","And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed."
 0.9269,"And We delivered him and his people from the Great Calamity,","And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
 0.9408,And made his progeny to endure (on this earth);,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
 0.9371,And We left (this blessing) for him among generations to come in later times:,"Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day."
 0.9162,"""Peace and salutation to Noah among the nations!""","Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt."
 0.9042,Thus indeed do we reward those who do right.,"Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes."
 0.9049,For he was one of our believing Servants.,Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.
 0.8853,Then the rest we overwhelmed in the Flood.,But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
 0.9112,Verily among those who followed his Way was Abraham.,So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
 0.9138,Behold! he approached his Lord with a sound heart.,"But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell."
 0.9065,"Behold! he said to his father and to his people, ""What is that which ye worship?","But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?"
 0.9025,"""Is it a falsehood- gods other than Allah- that ye desire?","And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering."
 0.8765,"""Then what is your idea about the Lord of the worlds?""",And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
 0.8792,Then did he cast a glance at the Stars.,"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
 0.9084,"And he said, ""I am indeed sick (at heart)!""","And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?"
 0.8844,"So they turned away from him, and departed.","But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
 0.9150,"Then did he turn to their gods and said, ""will ye not eat (of the offerings before you)?...","But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?"
 0.8708,"""What is the matter with you that ye speak not (intelligently)?""","For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?"
 0.8836,"Then did he turn upon them, striking (them) with the right hand.","And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
 0.8890,"Then came (the worshippers) with hurried steps, and faced (him).","But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door."
 0.9223,"He said: ""Worship ye that which ye have (yourselves) carved?",And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
 0.8887,"""But Allah has created you and your handwork!""",And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
 0.8816,"They said, ""Build him a furnace, and throw him into the blazing fire!""","And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar."
 0.9262,"(This failing), they then sought a stratagem against him, but We made them the ones most humiliated!","And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled."
 0.9139,"He said: ""I will go to my Lord! He will surely guide me!","And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me."
 0.9124,"""O my Lord! Grant me a righteous (son)!""",Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
 0.9069,So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear.,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father."
 0.9286,"Then, when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him, he said: ""O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!"" (The son) said: ""O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if Allah so wills one practising Patience and Constancy!""","And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
 0.9237,"So when they had both submitted their wills (to Allah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (for sacrifice),","He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,"
 0.9060,"We called out to him ""O Abraham!","And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad."
 0.9111,"""Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!"" - thus indeed do We reward those who do right.","And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
 0.8711,For this was obviously a trial-,And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
 0.9108,And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice:,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
 0.9271,And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times:,"Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day."
 0.8941,"""Peace and salutation to Abraham!""",And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:
 0.9042,Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.,"Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes."
 0.9049,For he was one of our believing Servants.,Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.
 0.9018,"And We gave him the good news of Isaac - a prophet,- one of the Righteous.","And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp."
 0.9308,"We blessed him and Isaac: but of their progeny are (some) that do right, and (some) that obviously do wrong, to their own souls.","Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day."
 0.9323,"Again (of old) We bestowed Our favour on Moses and Aaron,","And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death."
 0.9170,And We delivered them and their people from (their) Great Calamity;,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
 0.9092,"And We helped them, so they overcame (their troubles);","And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses."
 0.9157,And We gave them the Book which helps to make things clear;,But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
 0.9010,And We guided them to the Straight Way.,So the people rested on the seventh day.
 0.9276,And We left (this blessing) for them among generations (to come) in later times:,"Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day."
 0.8962,"""Peace and salutation to Moses and Aaron!""","Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram."
 0.9042,Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.,"Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes."
 0.9005,For they were two of our believing Servants.,Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.
 0.9184,So also was Elias among those sent (by Us).,Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.
 0.9194,"Behold, he said to his people, ""Will ye not fear (Allah)?","But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?"
 0.9375,"""Will ye call upon Baal and forsake the Best of Creators,-","And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment."
 0.8781,"""Allah, your Lord and Cherisher and the Lord and Cherisher of your fathers of old?""","And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,"
 0.9263,"But they rejected him, and they will certainly be called up (for punishment),-","Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money."
 0.9080,Except the sincere and devoted Servants of Allah (among them).,All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.
 0.9271,And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times:,"Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day."
 0.9002,"""Peace and salutation to such as Elias!""","Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt."
 0.9042,Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.,"Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes."
 0.9049,For he was one of our believing Servants.,Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.
 0.9212,So also was Lut among those sent (by Us).,Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.
 0.9263,"Behold, We delivered him and his adherents, all","The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
 0.8747,Except an old woman who was among those who lagged behind:,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?"
 0.9052,Then We destroyed the rest.,So the people rested on the seventh day.
 0.9311,"Verily, ye pass by their (sites), by day-","And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations."
 0.9175,And by night: will ye not understand?,"But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?"
 0.9209,So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).,Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.
 0.9183,"When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,","Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz."
 0.9193,"He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned:","And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;"
 0.9308,"Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.","And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father."
 0.8824,"Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,","When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;"
 0.9208,He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection.,But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
 0.9279,"But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,",And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
 0.9260,"And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.","And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number."
 0.9214,And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.,"And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:"
 0.8934,And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.,So the people rested on the seventh day.
 0.9210,"Now ask them their opinion: Is it that thy Lord has (only) daughters, and they have sons?-","And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?"
 0.9197,"Or that We created the angels female, and they are witnesses (thereto)?","And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life."

 0.8969,"""Allah has begotten children""? but they are liars!",Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.
 0.9035,Did He (then) choose daughters rather than sons?,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?"
 0.8654,What is the matter with you? How judge ye?,"And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
 0.9187,Will ye not then receive admonition?,"But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you."
 0.9015,Or have ye an authority manifest?,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him."
 0.9262,Then bring ye your Book (of authority) if ye be truthful!,"Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither."
 0.9175,And they have invented a blood-relationship between Him and the Jinns: but the Jinns know (quite well) that they have indeed to appear (before his Judgment-Seat)!,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father."
 0.9004,Glory to Allah! (He is free) from the things they ascribe (to Him)!,"Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."

 0.9457,"Thou wilt see the Wrong-doers in fear on account of what they have earned, and (the burden of) that must (necessarily) fall on them.

That will indeed be the magnificent Bounty (of Allah).","Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."
 0.9215,"That is (the Bounty) whereof Allah gives Glad Tidings to His Servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say: ""No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin.""

 0.9378,"And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and gives them increase of His Bounty: but for the Unbelievers their is a terrible Penalty.","The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation."
 0.9181,"If Allah were to enlarge the provision for His Servants, they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth; but he sends (it) down in due measure as He pleases. For He is with His Servants Well-acquainted, Watchful.","But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation."

 0.9302,"But let those know, who dispute about Our Signs, that there is for them no way of escape.","And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith."
 0.9316,Whatever ye are given (here) is (but) a convenience of this life: but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting: (it is) for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord:,"Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;"
 0.9248,"Those who avoid the greater crimes and shameful deeds, and, when they are angry even then forgive;","Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation."

 0.9143,"And those who, when an oppressive wrong is inflicted on them, (are not cowed but) help and defend themselves.","This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;"

 0.9297,"But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong (done) to them, against such there is no cause of blame.","And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;"
 0.9397,"The blame is only against those who oppress men and wrong-doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through the land, defying right and justice: for such there will be a penalty grievous.","Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation."
 0.9053,"But indeed if any show patience and forgive, that would truly be an exercise of courageous will and resolution in the conduct of affairs.","Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes."
 0.9370,"For any whom Allah leaves astray, there is no protector thereafter. And thou wilt see the Wrong-doers, when in sight of the Penalty, Say: ""Is there any way (to effect) a return?""",Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
 0.9485,"And thou wilt see them brought forward to the (Penalty), in a humble frame of mind because of (their) disgrace, (and) looking with a stealthy glance. And the Believers will say: ""Those are indeed in loss, who have given to perdition their own selves and those belonging to them on the Day of Judgment. Behold! Truly the Wrong-doers are in a lasting Penalty!""","The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes."
 0.9212,"And no protectors have they to help them, other than Allah. And for any whom Allah leaves to stray, there is no way (to the Goal).","Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day."
 0.9279,"Hearken ye to your Lord, before there come a Day which there will be no putting back, because of (the Ordainment of) Allah! that Day there will be for you no place of refuge nor will there be for you any room for denial (of your sins)!","According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not."
 0.9454,"If then they run away, We have not sent thee as a guard over them. Thy duty is but to convey (the Message). And truly, when We give man a taste of a Mercy from Ourselves, he doth exult thereat, but when some ill happens to him, on account of the deeds which his hands have sent forth, truly then is man ungrateful!","His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance."
 0.8743,"To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills (and plans). He bestows (children) male or female according to His Will (and Plan),","And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel."
 0.9367,"Or He bestows both males and females, and He leaves barren whom He will: for He is full of Knowledge and Power.","God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows."
 0.9114,"It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by the sending of a messenger to reveal, with Allah's permission, what Allah wills: for He is Most High, Most Wise.","He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:"

They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear to falsehood knowingly.","Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:"
 0.9162,Allah has prepared for them a severe Penalty: evil indeed are their deeds.,"Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."
 0.9378,They have made their oaths a screen (for their misdeeds): thus they obstruct (men) from the Path of Allah: therefore shall they have a humiliating Penalty.,"Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."
 0.9414,"Of no profit whatever to them, against Allah, will be their riches nor their sons: they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for aye)!","The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes."
 0.9189,"One day will Allah raise them all up (for Judgment): then will they swear to Him as they swear to you: And they think that they have something (to stand upon). No, indeed! they are but liars!","And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith."
 0.8810,"The Evil One has got the better of them: so he has made them lose the remembrance of Allah. They are the Party of the Evil One. Truly, it is the Party of the Evil One that will perish!","For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you."
 0.8651,Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be among those most humiliated.,"Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed."
 0.9043,"Allah has decreed: ""It is I and My messengers who must prevail"": For Allah is One full of strength, able to enforce His Will.","Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;"
 0.9398,"Thou wilt not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, loving those who resist Allah and His Messenger, even though they were their fathers or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred. For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow, to dwell therein (for ever). Allah will be well pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of Allah. Truly it is the Party of Allah that will achieve Felicity.","For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant."
 0.9101,"Whatever is in the heavens and on earth, let it declare the Praises and Glory of Allah: for He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky."
 0.9307,"It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces). Little did ye think that they would get out: And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But the (Wrath of) Allah came to them from quarters from which they little expected (it), and cast terror into their hearts, so that they destroyed their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the Believers, take warning, then, O ye with eyes (to see)!","Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it."
 0.9055,"And had it not been that Allah had decreed banishment for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world: And in the Hereafter they shall (certainly) have the Punishment of the Fire.",But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
 0.9145,"That is because they resisted Allah and His Messenger: and if any one resists Allah, verily Allah is severe in Punishment.","And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
 0.9405,"Whether ye cut down (O ye Muslim!) The tender palm-trees, or ye left them standing on their roots, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might cover with shame the rebellious transgresses.","Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them."
 0.9303,What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: but Allah gives power to His messengers over any He pleases: and Allah has power over all things.,"But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people."
 0.9404,"What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger (and taken away) from the people of the townships,- belongs to Allah,- to His Messenger and to kindred and orphans, the needy and the wayfarer; In order that it may not (merely) make a circuit between the wealthy among you. So take what the Messenger assigns to you, and deny yourselves that which he withholds from you. And fear Allah; for Allah is strict in Punishment.","This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation."
 0.9282,"(Some part is due) to the indigent Muhajirs, those who were expelled from their homes and their property, while seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure, and aiding Allah and His Messenger: such are indeed the sincere ones:-","If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering."
 0.9356,"But those who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith,- show their affection to such as came to them for refuge, and entertain no desire in their hearts for things given to the (latter), but give them preference over themselves, even though poverty was their (own lot). And those saved from the covetousness of their own souls,- they are the ones that achieve prosperity.","The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes."
 0.9475,"And those who came after them say: ""Our Lord! Forgive us, and our brethren who came before us into the Faith, and leave not, in our hearts, rancour (or sense of injury) against those who have believed. Our Lord! Thou art indeed Full of Kindness, Most Merciful.""","And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance."
 0.9358,"Hast thou not observed the Hypocrites say to their misbelieving brethren among the People of the Book? - ""If ye are expelled, we too will go out with you, and we will never hearken to any one in your affair; and if ye are attacked (in fight) we will help you"". But Allah is witness that they are indeed liars.","That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
 0.8891,"If they are expelled, never will they go out with them; and if they are attacked (in fight), they will never help them; and if they do help them, they will turn their backs; so they will receive no help.","And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people."
 0.9284,"Of a truth ye are stronger (than they) because of the terror in their hearts, (sent) by Allah. This is because they are men devoid of understanding.","For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you."
 0.9349,"They will not fight you (even) together, except in fortified townships, or from behind walls. Strong is their fighting (spirit) amongst themselves: thou wouldst think they were united, but their hearts are divided: that is because they are a people devoid of wisdom.","O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall."
 0.9332,"Like those who lately preceded them, they have tasted the evil result of their conduct; and (in the Hereafter there is) for them a grievous Penalty;-","To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste."
 0.9060,"(Their allies deceived them), like the Evil One, when he says to man, ""Deny Allah"": but when (man) denies Allah, (the Evil One) says, ""I am free of thee: I do fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!""","And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword."
 0.9196,"The end of both will be that they will go into the Fire, dwelling therein for ever. Such is the reward of the wrong-doers.",And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
 0.9330,"O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and let every soul look to what (provision) He has sent forth for the morrow. Yea, fear Allah: for Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.","Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you."
 0.9337,And be ye not like those who forgot Allah; and He made them forget their own souls! Such are the rebellious transgressors!,"And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:"
 0.9242,"Not equal are the Companions of the Fire and the Companions of the Garden: it is the Companions of the Garden, that will achieve Felicity.","And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
 0.9351,"Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, verily, thou wouldst have seen it humble itself and cleave asunder for fear of Allah. Such are the similitudes which We propound to men, that they may reflect.","And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."

(High is He) above the partners they attribute to Him.","He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he."
 0.9404,"He is Allah, the Creator, the Evolver, the Bestower of Forms (or Colours). To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth, doth declare His Praises and Glory: and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky."
 0.9394,"O ye who believe! Take not my enemies and yours as friends (or protectors),- offering them (your) love, even though they have rejected the Truth that has come to you, and have (on the contrary) driven out the Prophet and yourselves (from your homes), (simply) because ye believe in Allah your Lord! If ye have come out to strive in My Way and to seek My Good Pleasure, (take them not as friends), holding secret converse of love (and friendship) with them: for I know full well all that ye conceal and all that ye reveal. And any of you that does this has strayed from the Straight Path.","And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known."
 0.9218,"If they were to get the better of you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you for evil: and they desire that ye should reject the Truth.","The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways."
 0.9345,Of no profit to you will be your relatives and your children on the Day of Judgment: He will judge between you: for Allah sees well all that ye do.,"And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigor."
 0.9478,"There is for you an excellent example (to follow) in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people: ""We are clear of you and of whatever ye worship besides Allah: we have rejected you, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity and hatred for ever,- unless ye believe in Allah and Him alone"": But not when Abraham said to his father: ""I will pray for forgiveness for thee, though I have no power (to get) aught on thy behalf from Allah."" (They prayed): ""Our Lord! in Thee do we trust, and to Thee do we turn in repentance: to Thee is (our) Final Goal.","And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?

But if any turn away, truly Allah is Free of all Wants, Worthy of all Praise.","Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day."
 0.9264,"It may be that Allah will grant love (and friendship) between you and those whom ye (now) hold as enemies. For Allah has power (over all things); And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them."
 0.9214,"Allah forbids you not, with regard to those who fight you not for (your) Faith nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them: for Allah loveth those who are just.","Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God."
 0.9037,"Allah only forbids you, with regard to those who fight you for (your) Faith, and drive you out of your homes, and support (others) in driving you out, from turning to them (for friendship and protection). It is such as turn to them (in these circumstances), that do wrong.","And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people."
 0.8997,"O ye who believe! When there come to you believing women refugees, examine (and test) them: Allah knows best as to their Faith: if ye ascertain that they are Believers, then send them not back to the Unbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the Unbelievers, nor are the (Unbelievers) lawful (husbands) for them. But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent (on their dower), and there will be no blame on you if ye marry them on payment of their dower to them. But hold not to the guardianship of unbelieving women: ask for what ye have spent on their dowers, and let the (Unbelievers) ask for what they have spent (on the dowers of women who come over to you). Such is the command of Allah: He judges (with justice) between you. And Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.","And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigor."
 0.9256,"And if any of your wives deserts you to the Unbelievers, and ye have an accession (by the coming over of a woman from the other side), then pay to those whose wives have deserted the equivalent of what they had spent (on their dower). And fear Allah, in Whom ye believe.","The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls."
 0.9162,"O Prophet! When believing women come to thee to take the oath of fealty to thee, that they will not associate in worship any other thing whatever with Allah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit adultery (or fornication), that they will not kill their children, that they will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood, and that they will not disobey thee in any just matter,- then do thou receive their fealty, and pray to Allah for the forgiveness (of their sins): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God."
 0.9441,"O ye who believe! Turn not (for friendship) to people on whom is the Wrath of Allah, of the Hereafter they are already in despair, just as the Unbelievers are in despair about those (buried) in graves.","Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."

 0.9208,O ye who believe! Why say ye that which ye do not?,"But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;"
 0.9101,Grievously odious is it in the sight of Allah that ye say that which ye do not.,"For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God."
 0.8967,"Truly Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure.",So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
 0.9304,"And remember, Moses said to his people: ""O my people! why do ye vex and insult me, though ye know that I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you?"" Then when they went wrong, Allah let their hearts go wrong. For Allah guides not those who are rebellious transgressors.","And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper."
 0.9460,"And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: ""O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming the Law (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad."" But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, ""this is evident sorcery!""","And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence."
 0.9348,"Who doth greater wrong than one who invents falsehood against Allah, even as he is being invited to Islam? And Allah guides not those who do wrong.","If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering."
 0.9188,"Their intention is to extinguish Allah's Light (by blowing) with their mouths: But Allah will complete (the revelation of) His Light, even though the Unbelievers may detest (it).","Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."

 0.9245,"He will forgive you your sins, and admit you to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow, and to beautiful mansions in Gardens of Eternity: that is indeed the Supreme Achievement.","They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand."
 0.9248,"And another (favour will He bestow,) which ye do love,- help from Allah and a speedy victory. So give the Glad Tidings to the Believers.","And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment."
 0.9331,"O ye who believe! Be ye helpers of Allah: As said Jesus the son of Mary to the Disciples, ""Who will be my helpers to (the work of) Allah?"" Said the disciples, ""We are Allah's helpers!"" then a portion of the Children of Israel believed, and a portion disbelieved: But We gave power to those who believed, against their enemies, and they became the ones that prevailed.","And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?"

 0.9415,"It is He Who has sent amongst the Unlettered a messenger from among themselves, to rehearse to them His Signs, to sanctify them, and to instruct them in Scripture and Wisdom,- although they had been, before, in manifest error;-","And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy."

 0.9300,"The similitude of those who were charged with the (obligations of the) Mosaic Law, but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is that of a donkey which carries huge tomes (but understands them not). Evil is the similitude of people who falsify the Signs of Allah: and Allah guides not people who do wrong.","If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering."

 0.8936,"When the Hypocrites come to thee, they say, ""We bear witness that thou art indeed the Messenger of Allah."" Yea, Allah knoweth that thou art indeed His Messenger, and Allah beareth witness that the Hypocrites are indeed liars.","And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God."
 0.9358,They have made their oaths a screen (for their misdeeds): thus they obstruct (men) from the Path of Allah: truly evil are their deeds.,"Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them."

 0.9195,"When thou lookest at them, their exteriors please thee; and when they speak, thou listenest to their words. They are as (worthless as hollow) pieces of timber propped up, (unable to stand on their own). They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies; so beware of them. The curse of Allah be on them! How are they deluded (away from the Truth)!","Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not."
 0.9024,"And when it is said to them, ""Come, the Messenger of Allah will pray for your forgiveness"", they turn aside their heads, and thou wouldst see them turning away their faces in arrogance.","And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee."
 0.9250,It is equal to them whether thou pray for their forgiveness or not. Allah will not forgive them. Truly Allah guides not rebellious transgressors.,"And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment."
 0.9223,"They are the ones who say, ""Spend nothing on those who are with Allah's Messenger, to the end that they may disperse (and quit Medina)."" But to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the Hypocrites understand not.","And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
 0.9256,"They say, ""If we return to Medina, surely the more honourable (element) will expel therefrom the meaner."" But honour belongs to Allah and His Messenger, and to the Believers; but the Hypocrites know not.","And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:"
 0.9287,"O ye who believe! Let not your riches or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. If any act thus, the loss is their own.",Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
